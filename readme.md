# TheBard
TheBard is a text-based roleplaying game engine. It's intended for building interactive story-telling contents that can be played as an table-top rpg campaign.

## How does it work?
TheBard is a command line application able to read a specific-formatted JSON file and tell a story to the user which he/her can interact with. The player can take decisions and change the flow of the story. 

A content-maker structures a json file using easy commands and his/her screenplay habilities to tell an interactive story. It's possible to define variables and check them in order to make non-linear storylines.
